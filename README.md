# VRCDN Basic Diagnostic Tool
This is a basic diagnostic tool for VRCDN. It runs some tests on a user's system and submits a log to the VRCDN server.

 This has been in the works for a while but [@SticksDev](https://github.com/SticksDev) releasing their tool gave me a kick to finish and release this one.

 > [!NOTE] 
 > As always this isn't a definitive sign of zero issues if all tests pass, however if a test fails then issues are likely.

### Installation
There are compiled versions of this tool available under the releases.

### Usage
To run the diagnostic tool, use the following command:
```cmd
VRCDN-Network-Diagnostics.exe
```

You can also use the following options:
```
-a, --auto-submit: Automatically submit the log to VRCDN (Policies apply)
-h, --help: Show the help message
```
